					<p>
						I have always had more passions than I could keep up with, but that
						never stopped me from trying. I entered college as a Graphic
						Designer and will leave as a Web Designer and Developer who still
						loves graphic design and even studio art projects.<br />
						<br />
						I'm Natalie, a flamboyant web designer/front-end developer, graphic
						designer, and studio artist with a keen eye for exciting and unique
						designs.<br />
						I thrive on creating a world within a project that I can develop
						from start to finish.<br />
						<br />

						My journey began when I attended tech school for graphic design
						during my junior and senior high school years. Since then, I've had
						the privilege of studying web design and even interning at my
						university's web services as a junior web developer. Seeing what
						front-end development involves has only made me a better digital
						designer.<br />
						My creativity is sparked by a mix of caffeine, an overactive
						imagination, and a love for the mundane process of fixing code and
						design errors. Whether it's a team project, personal pursuit, or
						campaign all my own, I approach every situation with a contagiously
						positive attitude and blend innovation, dedication, and
						old-fashioned "stick-to-itiveness" to create designs that clients
						will never forget.<br />
						<br />

						Reach out any time—I'm open and ready to work with you or hear a
						good web development joke.
